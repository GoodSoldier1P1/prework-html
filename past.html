                    <p title="My Past, Just not the scary parts.">It's odd looking back at where you were, versus where you are now. I don't like to say this, but I've gone through Hell. I don't like to say this because Hell is defined in the Bible as a seperation from God (2 Thessalonians 1:9) and I know that I wasn't seperated from God. Rather I wasn't listening to Him! See, what I went through was too hard to put into words to be honest. To this day, close to ten years later, I still can barely sleep at night. Yet here I am? That's not a punctial error. I mean that as a question. What am I supposed to be doing now? I lose my whole world. What do I do now? If you really want to know, I wanted to die. Yeah I know that can be hard to read, but how many people have healed to the point that they can admit how low they were? That's not a brag, that's a blessing.<br>So I lose my world, but I learn how to live. How? That's a bit of a longer story.<br><br>
                        When I first got back home I truly didn't know what to do. I sat around, I slept, and I played video games. What I did every week though, is go to church. Now <strong>Fair Warning</strong>, I'm not your typical Christian. In fact there is a saying I live by;<br>"Jesus is Greater Than Religion"<br>I can make a whole web page just based on this saying, so I'll save you all the headache and give you the nutshell version. There's a reason Jesus flipped the tables (Matthew 21:12-13). There's also a reason that Moses smashed the first set of Commandments (Exodus 32:19). The Moses smashing the first set of tablets <em>actually is not</em> common knowledge to your average person. I have told my testimony and my beliefs to hundreds of people, and there have been preachers that didn't even know that, and it is written right there in the Bible. That's because, I'm about to make a lot of people mad, the average church <strong>doesn't</strong> preach God. It preaches people. People are the reason Jesus flipped the table. People are the reason that Moses smashed the tablets.<br><br>
                        So why do I say that? Why did I just make you sit there and read that? Well that's easy, because you wanted to know about me. I saw this first hand, I won't name any specific church or preacher, but I will tell you that I have been to dozens of churches personally and listened to hundreds of preachers. What I've been left with is a question. "Why aren't they preaching the God I know. The God that I've <strong>watched</strong> move mountains. Why aren't they preaching God?" So I did what I think all Christians should do. I started spreading the God that I know. The God of the Bible. I have another saying;<br>"I ain't no preacher."<br> If you can't tell from that, I'm from the South. I did this by doing what I already did every day, playing video games. I streamed daily on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/GoodSoldier1P1_7" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Twitch</a>, I joined a community of streamers and after a few short months I had well over 500 average viewers. During these streams my background music would be various types of worship music, such as;

                            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event.

                        Yeah those middle three are a bit odd, but hey you go listen to some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KB_HGA" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">KB</a> and tell me what you think of Christian Rap. Anyways, I did this for a while, then one day I realized something. I wasn't streaming for God anymore. I would always open my stream with a Daily Bible Verse. It got to a point that I wanted to do what the people wanted, and that was to play games. I realized I was becoming the average church. I couldn't do that. I couldn't do it to me or the people coming to watch me. So my PTSD told me to stop, and I did. Looking back, even though it was a rash decision, it was the right decision.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        After this happened, and a lot of prayer, I decided to start therapy. This is where I learned that I had PTSD. I couldn't believe it. Rather I didn't want to believe it. So I continued with my therapy. Eventually I got better. Not healed, but better. I started working and making a living for myself. That, however, is where we get to the <a href="present.html">Present</a>
