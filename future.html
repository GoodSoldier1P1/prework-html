        <h1>Finally! What I Love</h1>

        <p>
            My future! Oh no, my future! What is it going to be like? What will I be doing? Will I still think the way I do?<br><br>
            These are all valid questions. Some, if you think them enough, even become scary. So instead I force myself to think about what I want to do once this Coding Temple bootcamp is completed. I cannot think about the process of going through it because it scares the hell out of me, and I don't cuss mind you. I have less than three weeks to go through all the prework material, and submit <strong>this</strong> HTML. Then move on to the Python pre-work. It's scaring me a lot. Between all this work, and a pregnant wife, I'm truly scared. Yet I know that I can do it. So long as my wife understands that I am going to be working my butt off for the next 9 months, which she does. If we can get through this bootcamp, we can get through whatever any job could throw at me. I mean seriously, I am coding in bed while watching a YouTube video about a new game that I won't be able to play because all my time is already taken up between work and school. That part doesn't hurt, I mean what hurts is that I don't have enough RAM on my desktop to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/">Rust</a>, because the motherboard on my old desktop fried and the parts don't math the new one. *insert deep sigh* At least I can still play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">CS:GO</a>.<br><br>
            Wait, I'm supposed to be talking about my future. I mean um, I said all that on purpose, I can't help I like to talk, it's my mothers fault! So where was I? After this bootcamp, me and my wife will be able to handle anything that a job could throw at us. She knows that I am chasing my dream and understands that dreams don't come from just sitting around. I've broken bones, pulled muscles, and bled non stop chasing my dreams. You see, I used to fight MMA. I didn't go professional, almost, because of a neck injury. I have however had a few fights, won some (3) and lost some (two) and one thing I learned is that I can be in my own head and nervous and scared all I want, but when it comes time to take care of business I better be ready. Just like with this bootcamp. I'm scared to death, honestly I am, but when it comes down to it I will take care of business. I have no idea how CodeWars works, so I join the Zoom meetings through the Slack workshop to watch and pitch ideas (mostly else if's because that's all I semi understand at the moment) and see how more knowledgable coders think. If you don't know how to do something, go figure it out. That's something my parents told me growing up and honestly, it's some of the best advice that I will carry with me, and yes I will say it just as blunt as it sounded right there. That's the whole idea here. I want to figure out how to code so that I can become a Software Engineer.<br><br>
            I'm not finished there though, because just becoming a Software Engineer isn't enough. What I really want to do is become a game designer. Like, the whole nine yards. Make my own assets, write my own code, write my own anti-cheat. Make the web page for product information, but not handle the data because hopefully by then I can hire a team to help with that and other stuff. I already know that I want to hire my dad to write the story for one of the games I have brain stormed, this game is also the reason I went and started to learn Hard Surface Modeling.<br><br>
            See, my dad is an author, and yes he has publications! Just look for Colden Winter. Which is why I want him to write the story for this game. Not only will it help me, but that would mean that he is a part of the team, which means it's also a job for him. He will also be able to take a job and do something that he loves to do. Like I said before, making sure my family is happy is the most important thing to me. I may not have the perfect relationship with most of my family, but I'm still going to give them the upper hand whenever I can.<br><br>
            For now though, I am going to stash those thoughts under the dream category. Mainly because I have to take this one step at a time. Pre-work comes first, then bootcamp and homework. After that job searching and continuing to learn and do my best to be <a href="index.html">Home</a> for my family.
