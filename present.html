        <p>
            So here we are in the present. I've been married to my wonderful wife for a year and a half, and we are expecting our first child together. We have been raising one of our nephews for the last year, so he is now our middle son. My oldest son lives with his mother at the moment, and if you want to know what happened with him, well he was my world that I referenced. I have one more year until my world is complete again. Sadly though, that's all the information I will give on the subject, for now.<br><br>
            The present me is hard to explain I'm a;
            <ul class="mylist">
                <li>Father</li>
                <li>Husband</li>
                <li>Brother</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Yeah that's just a basic list of what millions of other people are. That's because I'm still figuring everything else out. Everything I do is done for my family. I virtually never do anything for myself. Which brings us to why I'm making this Portfolio. I'm finally doing something for myself. I have wanted to know how to code for a very long time. It was taking some time to figure out on my own, so I went and learned 3D modeling with <a href="http://www.blender.org" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Blender</a>. I've done this for a while, started to learn Hard Surface Modeling as well. We come back to what I really wanted to learn though, that being coding. So now I am enrolled in a bootcamp with Coding Temple!<br><br>
                None of us can lie about it, it's going to suck and it's going to suck a lot. I mean my baby could be born around the time my cohort starts. That's scary. My wife and I talked about it though. This is the best course to support our family, as well as to support myself and my mental health. See, I will have a laptop here soon that I got through Career Karma, and my wife knows that the chance of me coding while in the hospital while she's in labor is very high. I will <strong>always</strong> do what I need to do to support my family. If that means working on my homework while at a hospital, I'm going to do that. See, there's not many things that keep me moving forward these days. I'm an outcast to my brothers, my parents, well we can say they try. Nothing I have ever done has been good enough. Until now, until I started dating my wife. We got married after two months and the doctors told us flat out, she could never get pregnant. Guess what! God had other plans. Mr. Isaac David Amyx is proof that when God says He can do something, He will do it. God doesn't care what the doctors say. God doesn't care what anyone else says. If God says He will do something, it's going to be done.<br><br>
                I say this and I truly mean it. Something to keep in mind though, I'm still human. The battles that I face inside my head are the battles that nobody wants to talk about. I feel broken and worthless. In fact, I just had a conversation with my wife (at the time of creating this) where I told her that I feel like just by having me around, screws stuff up for everyone else. I told her this because I'm the black sheep. Everyone tries to hide it, but when it comes down to the wire, true colors show. To be honest, I wish one of two things. One, that people would just admit what they think about me. Two, they would realize that they don't know the truth and would ask me about it so that I can give them the facts so that they can make a true decision on how they feel. However, all of this is why i'm striving to succeed. I will get to the point to where I am able to do what I love and do that to take care of my family.<br>That, however, brings us to the <a href="future.html">Future.</a>
